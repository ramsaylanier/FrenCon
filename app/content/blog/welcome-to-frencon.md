# Announcing FrenCon 2026 — Yes, It's Real. No, We're Not Kidding.

Last year we went to GenCon. We had a blast. We also looked at our wallets and thought: *you know what?* We could save some money and just have our own board game convention amongst friends. **FrenCon 2026 is happening.** Mark your calendars. Clear your schedules. Tell your significant others you'll be "busy with friends" (they don't need to know you're arguing about train routes for six hours).

## What Is FrenCon?

We're a bunch of nerdy friends who decided that one game night a month wasn't enough — and that we didn't need to fly to Indianapolis to scratch that itch. So we're throwing our *first ever* convention — a weekend dedicated to knights, wizards, trains, and whatever other cardboard crack we can fit on a table.

No corporate sponsors. No lines. Just us, some dice, and the eternal debate over whether that last move was *technically* allowed.
